So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.,0,,,,
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!,0,,,,
I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.,0,,,,
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.,0,,,
Needless to say, I wasted my money.,0,,,
What a waste of money and time!.,0,,,,
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,0,,,,
The design is very odd," as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all.",0,,,
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!,0,,,,
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.,0,,,,
I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.,0,,,
The commercials are the most misleading.,0,,,,
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.,0,,,,
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.,0,,,,
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.,0,,,,
Doesn't hold charge.,0,,,,
This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.,0,,,
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.,0,,,,
I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.,0,,,,
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.,0,,,,
Poor Talk Time Performance.,0,,,,
worthless product.,0,,,,
I was not impressed by this product.,0,,,,
I only hear garbage for audio.,0,,,,
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.,0,,,,
AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.,0,,,,
Disappointed with battery.,0,,,,
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.,0,,,,
VERY DISAPPOINTED.,0,,,,
The buttons for on and off are bad.,0,,,,
Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.,0,,,,
Buy a different phone - but not this.,0,,,,
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.,0,,,,
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,0,,,,
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.,0,,,
Mic Doesn't work.,0,,,,
Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.,0,,,
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.,0,,,,
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!,0,,,,
Not a good bargain.,0,,,,
The battery runs down quickly.,0,,,,
This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.,0,,,
The construction of the headsets is poor.,0,,,,
For a product that costs as much as this one does, I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does.,0,,,
The ear buds only play music in one ear.,0,,,,
Dont waste your money...,0,,,,
If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.,0,,,,
I found this product to be waaay too big.,0,,,,
I'm very disappointed with my decision.,0,,,,
Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.,0,,,
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.,0,,,,
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).,0,,,
The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.,0,,
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.,0,,,,
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.,0,,,,
Could not get strong enough signal.,0,,,,
Bad Quality.,0,,,,
Basically the service was very bad.,0,,,,
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.,0,,,,
The BT headset was such a disapoinment.,0,,,,
Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.,0,,,,
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.,0,,,,
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.,0,,,,
What a waste.,0,,,,
During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.,0,,,
I was not happy with this item.,0,,,,
very disappointed.,0,,,,
The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally.,0,,,,
What a waste of time!,0,,,,
Its reception is very very poor.,0,,,,
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.,0,,,,
After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.,0,,,
I Was Hoping for More.,0,,,,
Audio Quality is poor, very poor.,0,,,
I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.,0,,,,
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.,0,,,
This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.,0,,,,
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.,0,,,
Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.,0,,,,
doesn't last long.,0,,,,
One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.,0,,,,
Thank you for wasting my money.,0,,,,
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.,0,,,,
I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.,0,,,
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.,0,,,,
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!,0,,,
Don't buy this product.,0,,,,
I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.,0,,,,
I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.,0,,,
Design Flaw?.,0,,,,
Waste of 13 bucks.,0,,,,
But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.,0,,
The replacement died in a few weeks.,0,,,,
I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.,0,,,,
Not impressed.,0,,,,
Bad Choice.,0,,,,
The pleather case doesn't fit.,0,,,,
useless phone, simply deaf.,0,,,
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.,0,,,,
Battery lasts only a few hours.,0,,,,
We are sending it back.,0,,,,
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.,0,,,,
If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.,0,,,
I also didn't like the "on" button, it felt like it would crack with use.,0,,,
WORST PHONE EVER.,0,,,,
Freezes frequently4.,0,,,,
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.,0,,,,
All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.,0,,,
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.,0,,,,
I'm a bit disappointed.,0,,,,
Good case, Excellent value.,1,,,
Great for the jawbone.,1,,,,
The mic is great.,1,,,,
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!,1,,,,
And the sound quality is great.,1,,,,
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.,1,,,,
Very good quality though,1,,,,
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.,1,,,,
So Far So Good!.,1,,,,

Nice headset priced right.,1,,,,
Excellent bluetooth headset.,1,,,,
It has all the features I want,1,,,,
This case seems well made.,1,,,,
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.,1,,,,
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.,1,,,,
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.,1,,,,
I love this thing!,1,,,,
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.,1,,,,
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!,1,,,,
I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.,1,,,,
I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.,1,,,
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.,1,,,,
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.,1,,,,
Great for iPODs too.,1,,,,
This device is great in several situations:1.),1,,,,

Nice docking station for home or work.,1,,,,

The phone loads super!,1,,,,
Made very sturdy.,1,,,,
Worked great!.,1,,,,
Will order from them again!,1,,,,
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.,1,,,,
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.,1,,,,
Definitely a bargain.,1,,,,
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.,1,,,,
Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.,1,,
I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.,1,,,
Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.,1,,,
This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.,1,,,,
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.,1,,,,
Great product, fast shipping!.,1,,,
Absolutely great.,1,,,,
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.,1,,,,
It is very comfortable on the ear.,1,,,,
It has been a winner for us.,1,,,,
)Setup couldn't have been simpler.,1,,,,
I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.,1,,,,
Iam very pleased with my purchase.,1,,,,
Gets the job done.,1,,,,
Great audio!.,1,,,,
I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.,1,,,

The accompanied software is almost brilliant.,1,,,,
Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.,1,,,,

Very good stuff for the price.,1,,,,
My headset works just peachy-keen.,1,,,,
Voice recognition is tremendous!,1,,,,
I got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and I'm glad I did.,1,,,,
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!,1,,,,
I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.,1,,
This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.,1,,,,

Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.,1,,,
You'll love how thin it is.,1,,,,
The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.,1,,,
All in all I think it was a good investment.,1,,,,
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.,1,,,,
great headset, very impressed - H500.,1,,,
The "1.2" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.,1,,
I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.,1,,,,
